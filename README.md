### Development workspace

![Screenshot of klondike workspace](/../screenshots/workspace.png?raw=true)

Included in this repository are two files relating to my development workspace;
`workspace.bash` and `workspace.desktop`. The former is a bash script which
when run will launch and arrange four terminals. The latter is
a [desktop entry file](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-latest.html)
which will run the aforementioned script.

The four terminals start with the following contents:

* Top left terminal opens `src/klondike.c` in `$EDITOR`.
* Top right terminal opens `src/klondike.h` in `$EDITOR`.
* Bottom left terminal runs your shell in the root of the klondike repository.
* Bottom right terminal runs `autothing.bash` which we'll get back to.

The development workspace script is made for use on Fedora 23. Additionally,
for the workspace script and desktop entry file to work, the repository root
must be at `$HOME/src/github.com/en90/klondike/`. If you choose to put
the repository elsewhere, you must remember to edit those two files
if you want to make use of them.

The development workspace script depends on the 256 color multi-language
version of rxvt-unicode known as `urxvt256c-ml`, because unlike `lxterminal`
which I had been using for a good while up until when I wrote this script,
`urxvt256c-ml` will set `_NET_WM_PID` correctly on Fedora 23 and so
I decided to switch to using `urxvt256c-ml` since I have previously been
a happy user of the 256 color version of rxvt-unicode and I figured that
if I was going to switch away from `lxterminal`, I wanted to see first
if 256 color rxvt-unicode would be behave as I wanted with regards to
`_NET_WM_PID` and furthermore, if I was going to switch to that,
I might as well try the multi-language version of it.

So that's what I ended up with.

```bash
sudo dnf install rxvt-unicode-256color-ml
```

Shortly after having written `workspace.bash`, I switched from LXDE to LXQt
because I've been meaning to do so as LXQt appears to be the future of LXDE,
and also I like Qt and welcome LXQt. I tested to see if `qterminal` would
set `_NET_WM_PID` to the expected value and indeed it appeared to
so one might say well why not just use qterminal then, but well I won't
because I like rxvt-unicode and the only reason I stopped using rxvt-unicode
was that I didn't bother to install and configure it at some point
and then stopped using it but now that I have it installed and configured
I'll stick with it for the foreseeable future.

My configuration of rxvt-unicode, by the way, simply amounts to
https://github.com/altercation/solarized/blob/master/xresources/solarized
with the following two lines added:

```
URxvt.font: xft:Droid Sans Mono:size=14
URxvt.scrollBar_right: true
```

Subsequently, I did

```bash
sudo dnf install google-droid-sans-mono-fonts
xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources
```

With that in place then, I made the desktop entry file to run the script.
This desktop entry file I then added to the quicklaunch on the LXQt panel.
I did so by modifying `~/.config/lxqt/panel.conf` but one might as well
just drag and drop the desktop entry file onto the quicklaunch widget.

Furthermore after that, I used `lxqt-config` (LXQt Configuration Center)
and a couple of other means to make changes including turning on
focus follows mouse, switching icons theme to *Nimbus*,
LXQt theme to *Ambiance*, setting the desktop background picture
to `/usr/share/backgrounds/f23/extras/fog.jpg`, setting GUI font
to *Noto Sans* and picking a matching color for the panel;
`#88cf8a` with opacity set to about 0.5.
Being able to make these changes requires

```bash
sudo dnf install nimbus-icon-theme f23-backgrounds-extras-base \
                 google-noto-sans-fonts
```

And uh, that about covers everything I did, most of which might not be
very interesting. So there's that.

Sorry about how long this section of the README became.

### `autothing.bash`

The `autothing.bash` script rebuilds klondike and runs it under valgrind
each time a source file is modified. In contrast to the workspace stuff,
this script works fine on all of the supported platforms of klondike.

To install the dependecies for `autothing.bash`, I do

```bash
sudo pkg install inotify-tools valgrind # on FreeBSD 10.2
```

```bash
sudo dnf install inotify-tools make gcc valgrind # on Fedora 23
```

```bash
sudo apt-get install inotify-tools make gcc valgrind # on Debian GNU/Linux 8
```
